# Print out first 100 triangle numbers. A triangle number is a number of dots which could be arranged into a triangle. The formula for a triangle number is x sub n = n(n + 1)/2. For example, the 30th triangle number is x sub 30 = 30(30 + 1)/2 = 465

number = 1

while number <= 100:
    triangle_number = number * (number + 1) / 2
    print("Triangle number %d is %d" % (number, triangle_number))
    number += 1
